# Fortnite-External-Csharp
I did this because I had nothing to do. I was testing it on build ++Fortnite+Release-37.00-CL-44501951-Windows and it was working correctly. If you want to put it to work in your build, look for the updated offsets and update it in the project. Remembering that this project is only ESP, if you want aimbot, put it yourself
